# Desk Site

Website containing desktop inspired by Windows 98 and Linux.

## Detailed description

This website contains replica of Windows 98, which I find very nice looking +
it's nostalgic. But to be fair, I don't really know Windows terminal, because
I use Linux (I use Arch btw), so to make things easier, terminal is implemented
Linux like. File system is also implemented like on Unix systems (not yet).

This website is still work in progress, so many things are still missing or not
fully functioning.

## Technologies

Desk site is created using React with Javascript. You can run the website like
this:

```terminal
npm run
```
