# winux

Website containing desktop inspired by **Windows 98** and **Linux**.

## Technologies

Desk site is created using **React** with **Javascript**
*(I should've used Typescript).*

Only package I used is `gh-pages` in order to deploy website to
[Github pages](martan03.github.io/winux).

React project itself was generated using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).

### Usage:
You can run the website using **npm**:

```terminal
npm run dev
```

## Detailed description

This website contains replica of **Windows 98**, which I find very nice
looking + it's nostalgic. But to be fair, I don't really know Windows terminal,
because I use Linux *(I use Arch btw)*, so to make things easier, terminal is
implemented Linux like. File system is also implemented like on Unix systems
(not fully yet).

This website is still work in progress, so many things are still missing or not
fully functioning. Terminal is still far from finished and file system
resets for every terminal (and doesn't work with the desktop yet)

### Motivation

I've seen a video, where they implemented a terminal on their website.
I found it very interesting and wanted to try it myself. But to make things a
bit original, I decided to do full desktop. And what other OS to use then
Windows 98, even though I'm too young, so I haven't tried it myself :). So if
somethings isn't as it was in the system, you can let me know.
